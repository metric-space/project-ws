# Raycasting in Purescript

Always was fascinated by the Wolfenstein raycaster engine so decided to finally sit down and do it in purescript

This was a little experiment in Purescript + Canvas + a little bit of purescript behaviour.

The code is mostly a purescript rewrite of [https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

And the 2d map overview idea was inspired by [https://dev.opera.com/articles/3d-games-with-canvas-and-raycasting-part-1/](https://dev.opera.com/articles/3d-games-with-canvas-and-raycasting-part-1/)

## A massive refactor is till in order, however it works!

2. open index.html location in browser (You don't have to (trans)compile purescript code)
